# Titanic Dataset Analysis ðŸš¢
## SCT_DS_02
This project is part of the internship tasks assigned by **Skill Craft Technology**. It focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to understand survival patterns, handle missing data, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Project Overview

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**
   - Load and preview the Titanic dataset.

2. **Handling Missing Data**
   - Identify missing values.
   - Impute missing data using appropriate methods.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Convert categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Embarkation) into numerical values for analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Perform descriptive statistics.
   - Analyze survival rates by:
     - Gender
     - Ticket class
     - Port of embarkation
   - Visualize data distributions and survival trends.
   - Investigate correlations among numerical features.

## Key Insights

- **Overall Survival Rate:** 38%.
- **Gender:** Female passengers had much higher survival rates compared to males.
- **Ticket Class:** Passengers in first class had the highest survival rates.
- **Embarkation Port:** Passengers embarking from Cherbourg showed higher survival rates.
- **Age Distribution:** 
  - Most passengers were aged 20-40 years.
  - Survival rates decreased with age.
- **Correlation:** Strong correlation observed between ticket class and survival rates.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
