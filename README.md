## Titanic Dataset Analysis
This project is a part of the internship tasks assigned by Skill Craft Technology. It involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to understand key patterns, missing data handling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

# Project Overview
The task focuses on the following steps:

Data Loading: Load and preview the Titanic dataset.
Handling Missing Data: Identify and impute missing values.
Data Transformation: Convert categorical variables into numerical values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Descriptive statistics.
Analysis of survival rates by gender, ticket class, and port of embarkation.
Visualization of data distributions and survival trends.
Correlation Analysis: Investigate correlations among numerical features.

# Key Insights
The overall survival rate was 38%.
Female passengers had a much higher survival rate compared to males.
Passengers in first-class tickets had the highest survival rates.
Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg survived more compared to other ports.
Most passengers were aged 20-40 years, with survival rates decreasing with age.
There is a strong correlation between ticket class and survival rates.
